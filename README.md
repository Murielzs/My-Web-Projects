# WR-Website

This repository folder is for editing .html files for my website.
I am completely new to development. I am building my own wordpress website hosted by 1&1. I discovered Chrome Dev Tool but realised I couldn't edit the .html of my web pages through it. I came across Github, I have an online account and set up Github Desktop on my mac OS High Sierra. But I a still not sure how this all works. How can I link my existing website to github???

I am totally out of my depth here!
